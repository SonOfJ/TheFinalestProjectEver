# TheFinalestProjectEver

## Project Description

This game attempts to recreate the classic arcade Pac-Man game. The user uses arrow keys to guide Pac-Man through a maze to eat Pac-Dots, while avoiding the four ghosts roaming around the maze. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, the user loses a life and when all lives are lost, the game is over.

## How to Run Program

**1. The Map File**

The blueprint of the map that will be used in the game will be located in a text file titled "Map.txt". The file will contain letters that symbolizes what should be created.
P: Pac-Man
N: Nodes (spots where Pac-Man can move on)
D: Dots that can be consumed by Pac-Man to generate points for the player
G: Ghosts

**2. Controls**

The player will be controlling Pac-Man. The player will be able to move him in four different directions.
- W: Up
- S: Down
- A: Left
- D: Right

## Development Log

### May 16, 2019
**Christy**
- During this in class work period, I created the PacMan file and wrote the skeleton for the methods to be completed. I also created the outline for the README file so that we can easily update it later.

**Jason**
- During this work period, I copied over the node class from last semester and started work on the Maze class.



### May 18, 2019
**Christy**
- I worked on the PacMan and Ghost classes. I wrote the methods to load the images in and display the images, but I will need to update it later once we move from Java files to Processing. I also found PNG files for PacMan and the four ghosts. Lastly, I worked a little bit on the Maze class and wrote the constructor and the method to add a Node in each of the four directions.



### May 19, 2019
**Jason**
- I created the Dot class and also a launcher which will start up the game. I used scanner to attempt to create a map that can be displayed in processing. I created a test text file with special letters that symbolize what should be at the respective locations. I also started to work on the directions, specifically adding what each letter in the text file map symbolizes.

### May 20, 2019
**Christy**
- In class, I wrote the move and eat methods for Pacman and I also had to add extra methods to the Node class for this to work. I had a lot of trouble with merging branches, so I spent most of the class time trying to resolve the problems. I was unable to fix it, so at home, I had to delete the branch I was working in and rewrite the methods I was working on.
