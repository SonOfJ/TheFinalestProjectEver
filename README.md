# TheFinalestProjectEver

## Project Description

This game attempts to recreate the classic arcade Pac-Man game. The user uses arrow keys to guide Pac-Man through a maze to eat Pac-Dots, while avoiding the four ghosts roaming around the maze. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, the user loses a life and when all lives are lost, the game is over.
