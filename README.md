# TheFinalestProjectEver

## Project Description

This game attempts to recreate the classic arcade Pac-Man game. The user uses arrow keys to guide Pac-Man through a maze to eat Pac-Dots, while avoiding the four ghosts roaming around the maze. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, the user loses a life and when all lives are lost, the game is over.

- During this in class work period, I created the PacMan file and wrote the skeleton for the methods to be completed. I also created the outline for the README file so that we can easily update it later.

- During this work period, I copied over the node class from last semester and started work on the Maze class.

- I worked on the PacMan and Ghost classes. I wrote the methods to load the images in and display the images, but I will need to update it later once we move from Java files to Processing. I also found PNG files for PacMan and the four ghosts. Lastly, I worked a little bit on the Maze class and wrote the constructor and the method to add a Node in each of the four directions.
